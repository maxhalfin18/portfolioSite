# Max Halfin Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio site designed to showcase selected projects and allow visitors to get in touch directly.

## Features

- **Modern, responsive web design** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Project presentation section** with images, live GitHub links, and hover effects
- **Contact form** with validation, styled textarea, and animated feedback
- **Social links** with custom icons (Facebook, Instagram, GitHub, LinkedIn)
- **Favicon** (tab logo) using `assets/s1.png`
- **Open Graph & Twitter Card meta tags** for beautiful link previews when sharing
- **Smooth scroll navigation** with animated offset for sticky header
- **Separation of concerns:** all JavaScript in `script.js`, all styles in `style.css`
- **Mobile-first and fully responsive** (breakpoints for 900px, 600px, 400px)

## Technologies Used

- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Node.js + Express (for backend/contact form)

## Favicon

The favicon (tab logo) is set to `assets/s1.png`.
